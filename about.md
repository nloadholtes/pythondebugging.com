# Debugging can be fun
Python is an awesome programming language. It is easy to read, great for writing amazing applications with, and it can be fun to debug too!

## Our mission
Debugging is a skill that is seen as the domain of more experinced programmers or "wunder kids". In truth, debugging is a skill, and like any skill it can be developed and taught.

Many schools don't really teach debugging. We aim to correct this by showing examples of the tools and techniques you can use **today** to start getting your code working.
